Does your program run without error?: No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
I had a lot of trouble with .multiply(), and it continues to
give stack overflow errors. To my knowledge, that is the only portion
of this program that runs incorrectly. Though, it was very hard to test
seeing as multiply was used in a majority what we had to implement.
